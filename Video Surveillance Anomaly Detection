Tools: Python, Machine Learning, Data Analysis

Goal:
To detect abnormal behaviour in surveillance video datasets and improve automated monitoring.

What I did:

Preprocessed large video surveillance datasets

Extracted motion-based features for anomaly detection

Implemented machine learning models to identify abnormal events

Evaluated performance using ROC-AUC, precision, recall, and F1-score

Outcome:

Successfully detected abnormal patterns and produced visual outputs highlighting anomaly regions, demonstrating the ability to analyse large datasets and deliver structured analytical results.
